/api/incidents — list and filter incidents.

Demonstrates PostGIS in action:
  - ST_X / ST_Y to pull lat/lng back out of the geometry column
  - EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ...) for time-of-day filtering
  - A spatial bounding-box filter so we don't ship every incident
    to the client when they only want one neighborhood
