"""
Risk scoring service.

Given a list of incidents, produce a per-point or per-grid risk score
using kernel density estimation (KDE) with:

  1. Severity weights  — sexual assault counts more than theft
  2. Time decay        — old incidents fade out exponentially
  3. Spatial spread    — each incident becomes a Gaussian bump,
                         not a single dot

This is what makes the heatmap look smooth and meaningful instead of
just a bunch of disconnected dots.
